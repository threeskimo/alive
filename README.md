# alive.sh
A shell script that will check a list of URLs from a txt file to see if they are alive.  It will then spit out the results in a "results.txt" file.

## Why?
Because I needed a way to check a large list of URLs to see if they were alive or not.

## Usage
```
alive.sh [<list_of_urls.txt>]
```
